I am driven to learn new things and exceed expectations. I sought a new career path out of a desire for growth and advancement that I did not feel was present in my previous career. I want to see my efforts transformed into meaningful development. I am interested in continuous growth for myself and my career.

While earning my B.S. in Information Technnology, I have consistently sought out additional learning experiences and given extra effort to gain practical skills in addition to theory. Developing my home lab infrastructure has been a valuable resource in building foundational skills in networking, configuration, system administration, virtualization, troubleshooting, and identifying solutions.
