I am driven to learn new things and exceed expectations. I worked as a Registered Nurse in ICU and critical settings for 12 years.
While I found the work challenging and, many times, profoundly rewarding, I sought a new career path for myself out of a desire for
growth and advancement that I did not feel was available in that field. I want to see my efforts transformed into meaningful development
for myself and my career. I am interested in continuous growth.

In addition to earning my B.S. in Information Technology, I have actively developed a home lab infrastructure incorporating a firewall, switch,
server, and PC. This environment helped develop numerous practical skills in networking, security, firewall administration, virtualization, containerization,
system administration, troubleshooting, and identifying solutions. In my homelab, using virtualization and containerization, I have been able to experiment 
with real-world setups and security tools.

Interactive security platforms like Try Hack Me and Hack The Box have also been crucial for additional learning and practical training. 
I have earned industry certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ and Network+. I am preparing for AWS Cloud certifications and considering the CompTIA CySA+,
Linux+, and possibly CEH.
