faq_items:
  - title: Why did you choose IT and cybersecurity as a career?
    description: I have always been tech-oriented. Electronics, breadboards, and PC building were some of my hobbies growing up.
      I chose to pursue cybersecurity because that is what interests me, it is that simple. It holds my attention and I genuinely enjoy learning about it.<br><br>
      I want to do this, and I am committed, capable, and persistent.<br><br>


  - title: What are your career plans?
    description: Ultimately, my goal is to break into cybersecurity at an entry level position, ideally as a SOC Analyst Tier 1.
      I am technically inclined and have pursued additional hands-on learning through home lab projects, certifications, and interactive platforms to strengthen my skill set for this role.<br><br>
      Looking ahead, I aim to transition into Security Engineering, to focus on designing and implementing security infrastructure, systems, and controls.

      Realistically, I understand cybersecurity is not considered an entry level position, regardless of the role. With this in mind, I am also preparing for other entry points into the industry such as
      Support, Helpdesk, Networking, and Systems Admininstration. 

  - title: What extra steps have you taken to make yourself competitive?
    description: In addition to earning my BSIT, I have actively developed a home lab, used virtualization, and containerization to experiment with real-world setups and security tools.<br><br>
      Interactive security platforms like Try Hack Me and Hack The Box have also been crucial for additional learning and practical training.<br><br>
      I have earned industry certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ and Network+.<br><br>
      Currently I am considering the CompTIA CySA+, Linux+, and AWS Cloud certifications.

  - title: What transferrable skills do you bring from your previous career?
    description: Having worked as an ICU Nurse for over a decade, I developed excellent interpersonal communication skills, as well as high quality customer service. Attention to detail and critical thinking ability were crucial to successful outcomes.<br><br>
      I'm also accustomed to performing as an integral part of a multidisciplinary team in a demanding professional environment.

#  - title: How long does it take to develop a product design?
#    description: The development time depends on the complexity of the project. Usually, creating a product design takes from several weeks to several months.

#  - title: How can I contact you to discuss my project?
#    description: You can contact me through the contact form on my website or directly via email. I'm always open to new projects and ready to discuss your idea.
